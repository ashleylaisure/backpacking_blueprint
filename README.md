# Backpacking Blueprint

#### Planning a thru-hike is exciting, but it can also be overwhelming. From finding the right trails to organizing gear, food, and resupply points, thereâ€™s a lot to keep track of. Thatâ€™s where Backpacking Blueprint comes in.

Backpacking Blueprint is a comprehensive app designed for thru-hikers of all levels. Whether you're preparing for your first long-distance trek or your tenth, Backpacking Blueprint helps you simplify and streamline every part of the planning process.

## Description

Growing up in Colorado, I developed a deep love for the outdoors and backpacking. It's something Iâ€™ve always wanted to do more of, but the stress of everyday life often makes planning a hiking tripâ€”especially those lasting 3 to 5 days or even up to 3 weeksâ€”feel overwhelming.

Thatâ€™s what inspired me to create this app: a tool to take the stress out of trip planning and make it easier to actually get outside. With this app, you can organize all the small but important detailsâ€”from coordinating travel to and from the trailhead, mapping out campsites, packing the right gear, and figuring out how much food you can realistically carry.

My hope is that this app empowers people to design their own adventures and finally get out there, instead of just dreaming about it.
